      "description": "A c.1875 view of North Main Street from the intersection with Main Street. The brick building barely visible on the left is the Rankin Block. The small building to the right of the Rankin Block is a barbershop. Further up North Main Street on the left is the two-story brick house built by David Gay. This is where the Free Press is located today. A wagon loaded with barrels probably from Blackington’s Corner or beyond can be seen in the middle of North Main Street on its way to a lime kiln along the shore."
